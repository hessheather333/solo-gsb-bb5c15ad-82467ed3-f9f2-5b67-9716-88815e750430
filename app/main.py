        "date is on or after as_of + min_remaining_days may serve that "
        "demand, and the weight ruled out by that threshold is reported "
        "per demand as excluded_weight. Every demand may instead set "
        'package_mode "whole" to treat each eligible scan as an indivisible '

        "The response keeps the rule order and reports per-rule package "
        "counts and six-decimal half-even total weights, plus an aggregate "
        "of the items no rule matched. POST /trace-audit applies ordered "
        "traceability events (type receive/pick/ship plus a scan carrying "
        "AI 01, AI 21 and optionally AI 10/AI 17) to the per-item "

        "recorded as anomalies without moving the state, and events of one "
        "item conflicting on batch or expiry are rejected with the current "
        "and first event indices. The response keeps the event order and "
        "reports the state before/after each event plus its anomaly, and "
        "summarises the items by final state. POST /batch-genealogy "
        "audits a production batch genealogy over opening batch stock "

        "material scan (opening stock, process input or output) carries "

        "are identified by GTIN + lot and aggregated with exact Decimal "
        "arithmetic in the target unit. A batch may be produced by at "
        "most one process, every consumed batch must come from the "
        "opening stock or a process output, and the producer/consumer "
        "dependency graph must be acyclic -- violations reject the whole "
